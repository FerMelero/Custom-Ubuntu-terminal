This is a bash script that runs in a new window, simulating the operation of the normal Ubuntu shell.

The terminal displays an ASCII image and brief general information about the hardware and software on which it runs. Above the prompt the PID of the terminal is displayed.

## Execution

1.- To run the script, we first have to have all the contents downloaded in a directory of the Linux operating system. (script.sh and .gif (_optional_))

2.- Once downloaded and located in the directory where they are located, we execute the command `chmod 777 script.sh` to change the permissions of the file so that we can execute it.

_(Optional)_

Download nsnake 

```

```

3.- Finally, we exit superuser mode if we are and type `gnome-terminal --fullscreen -- ./script.sh`, this will run the script in a new GNOME terminal and it will open in full screen.
